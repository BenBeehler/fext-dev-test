         Write a javascript function that will grab the JSON content from: 
         https://api.fext.co/v1/users/937/history

         Display it in an HTML table on this page. (You will need to create the table)

         The listing should show the date and the protein, carbs, fat, and calories consumed on that date as well as the percentage to daily target for each one. 

         All of the data is available to you in the JSON response.

         For this exercise, you do not need to factor in pagination
